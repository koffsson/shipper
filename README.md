# Microservices in Golang

This is my implementation of the microservices-in-golang blog. It is a
10-step guide on how to create a shipping container management
platform. The first blog post can be found [here](https://ewanvalentine.io/microservices-in-golang-part-1/).

## Getting Started (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

* [gRPC/protobuf](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go.html) - Googles remote procedure call
and the accompanying protocol buffer. Follow the instructions to get gRPC up and running.
* [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) - A pluggable gRPC framework. After gRPC/protobuf is installed, run the following command:

```
go get -v -u github.com/micro/protobuf/{proto,protoc-gen-go}
```

### Installing (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment (IN NEED OF UPDATE(S))

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
